# Bash scripting

"The Bourne-again shell"

### What bash is

Being a UNIX shell, bash is an interactive command language as well as
a scripting programming language.

### What bash isn't

Unfortunately, bash is not quite on par with most general-purpose
programming languages.

### Careful!

Be careful with special characters (and spaces).

And don't type e.g.  `rm -rf * /` (instead of the intended `rm -rf */`).

### Bourne shell

NB: `/bin/sh != /bin/bash` (unless it is).

---

### Some fun stuff

* `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`
* `$PS1`, `alias`
* `shopt`, `set -e`, `set -n`, `set -v`, `set +x`

<!-- -->

* `/proc`, `/dev` (everything's a file)
* `/etc/init.d/*`

```bash
sed 's!foo!bar!g' -i some_file
```

```bash
mount | grep ^/ | awk '{ print $1 }'
```

---

#### Software Tools Principles

* Do one thing well.
* Process lines of text, not binary.
* Use regular expressions.
* Default to standard I/O.
* Don't be chatty.
* Generate the same output format as accepted as input.
* Let someone else do the hard part.
* Detour to build specialized tools.

#### The UNIX Philosophy (Mike Gancarz)

* Small is beautiful.
* Make each program do one thing well.
* Build a prototype as soon as possible.
* Choose portability over efficiency.
* Store data in flat text files.
* Use software leverage to your advantage.
* Use shell scripts to increase leverage and portability.
* Avoid captive user interfaces.
* Make every program a filter.

## A shell script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```

## Being funny

```bash
say_hi () { echo "Hi, $1!"; }
say_hi Bob
```

---

## Being optional

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e

foo=/some/file bar=42

usage () { echo 'myscript [-f FOO] [-b BAR]' >&2; exit 1; }

while getopts :f:b: opt; do
  case "$opt" in
    f)  foo="$OPTARG" ;;
    b)  bar="$OPTARG" ;;
    :)  echo "missing argument for: -$OPTARG" >&2; usage ;;
    \?) echo "invalid option: -$OPTARG"       >&2; usage ;;
  esac
done

[ "$OPTIND" -gt "$#" ] || usage

cleanup () { echo 'cleaning up...'; }
trap cleanup EXIT

do_something_with "$foo" "$bar"
```

---

## Being selective

```bash
select choice in FOO BAR BAZ; do
  if [ -n "$choice" ]; then
    echo "You chose: $choice"
    break
  else
    echo 'You need to choose!'
  fi
done
```

---

## Being amphibian

```bash
whiptail --inputbox -- "What is your name?" 10 60 2> /tmp/your_name
```

---

## Being amphibian w/ eft.sh

```bash
say_hi () { echo "Hello, $1!"; }
eft_ask 'What is your name?' on_ok=say_hi
```

---

## Being zen

```bash
zenity --warning --text "OOPS"

zenity --file-selection --title 'Which file?'
```

---

## Being functional w/ map.sh

```bash
map -v 'echo "$it"; echo ${#it}' foo 'bar baz'
# ==> echo foo
# foo
# ==> echo 3
# 3
# ==> echo 'bar baz'
# bar baz
# ==> echo 7
# 7

# find files and echo dirname of canonical path
find -type f -print0 | sort -z | map -f0 'echo "$path_dir"'

# find 4-char files
find -type f -print0 | sort -z | filter -f0 '[ "${#base}" == 4 ]'
```
